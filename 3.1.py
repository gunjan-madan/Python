# Uncomment the below statements and click Run
#t=5//3
#v=7%4
#w=2**3
#print(t)
#print(v)

# What did you get? Do you know why? 
# The // operator divides the 5  by 3 and only gives the integer value, not the remainder
# The % (modulus) operator gives the remainder when 7 is divided by 4.
# The ** is used like the exponent operator. So it is read as 2 raised to the power 3

#DIY
#Use to operators to print Quotient and Remainder when we divide 126 by 3
#Print 4^5 using the operators
